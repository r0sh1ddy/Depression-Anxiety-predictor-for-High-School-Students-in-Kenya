Mental Health Screening App - Kenya

This tool screens for depression (PHQ-8) and anxiety (GAD-7) using questionnaire responses and demographic data.
It automatically selects the best-performing model (by recall) and shows an explanation of feature importance using SHAP.
This is a screening tool, not a diagnostic instrument. If you are worried about your mental health, please contact a counselor or health professional.
