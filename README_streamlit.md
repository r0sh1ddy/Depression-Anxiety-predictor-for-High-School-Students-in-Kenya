After clicking "**üîç Analyze Mental Health Status**", you'll see:

1. **Model Information Badges**
   - Which AI model was used for Depression
   - Which AI model was used for Anxiety
   - Their recall scores (accuracy in detecting true cases)

2. **Depression Assessment Card**

##  Understanding the AI Explanations (SHAP)

### **What is SHAP?**

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) shows you **which factors** most influenced your prediction.

### **How to Read SHAP Charts:**

- **Vertical Axis:** Lists features (your responses and demographics)
- **Horizontal Axis:** Shows impact strength
- **Top Features:** Had the strongest influence on the prediction
- **Bar Colors:** 
  - üî¥ Red/Warm colors: Pushed toward higher severity
  - üîµ Blue/Cool colors: Pushed toward lower severity

**Example Interpretation:**
```
PHQ_2 (Feeling down/hopeless)     ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà
GAD_3 (Worrying too much)         ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà
Age                               ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà
```
This means:
- Your response to "Feeling down/hopeless" had the biggest impact
- "Worrying too much" was also very influential
- Age had a moderate influence
